 In the world of genomics, there is often a focus on the differences between RNA
 sequences, especially when it comes to catching anomalies that could be causing illness in a
 person or, more broadly, the difference between different species of animals. Conversely, there is
 also a focus on similarity in the sense of how similar other organisms are to each other. Of
 course, in many aspects, humans are very different from a chicken, and in the same sense, both
 humans and chickens are very different than bacteria. Even within the same species of
 organisms, such as bacteria, there are many differences in how they function, infect their host,
 and look in shape. However, despite these differences, all living things originate from the same
 single-celled organisms, and as a result, even through millions of years of evolution, it can be
 seen that there are some things coded in very different bacteria that are 100% percent identical.
 These are known as ultra-conserved elements (UCEs); they represent artifacts of phylogenetic
 lineage from species to species. While ultraconserved elements (UCEs) first started off as having
 a strictly 100% match of 200 or more subsequence contiguous bases shared between two or more
 different genomes (Ryu, 2012), researchers unsatisfied with such strict limitations began
 exploring and tweaking different parameters such as the conservation threshold being lower than
 100% at values such as 90%- 95% and seeing if they could still find useful information via these
 lesser conserved UCEs. Researchers also started adjusting how many bases quantified as UCEs,
 even going as low as the length of 100 or more contiguous bases instead of the original 200
 (Wikipedia, 2023).
 Though ultraconserved elements have been studied before, rarely has it been explored
 adjusting the parameters and threshold and attempting to see if any useful information can come
 from smaller ultraconserved elements even if they have less information and uniqueness.
